# Retreiving process and response evaluated and explained by LLM agents

#TODO
* Finish the project and remove all your API keys, write in the README how the user can create their own keys and populate their index
* Write one app accessible by anyone with a backend script with your API keys
* Search how to share a streamlit page via web accessible by anyone (streamlit cloud)
* Make the response stream (and maybe also the side bar)

* Create a copy of this folder deleting all the personal info (api keys like the openai one) and leaving just the new pinecone key
* Upload the folder on github and deploy it on streamlit
